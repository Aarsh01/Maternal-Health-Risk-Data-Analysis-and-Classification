1. **OBJECTIVE**
  Maternal mortality is unacceptably high. About 370 000 women died during and following   pregnancy and childbirth in 2020. Most of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.
  • Every day in 2020, approximately 910 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.
  • 94% of all maternal deaths occur in low and lower middle-income countries.
  • Young adolescents (ages 10-14) face a higher risk of complications and death because of pregnancy than other women.
  • Skilled care before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of women and new-borns.

2. **Introduction to Data Set**
  Abstract: Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares from the rural areas through the IoT based risk monitoring system.
  Data Set Information: Age, Systolic Blood Pressure as SystolicBP, Diastolic BP as DiastolicBP, Blood Sugar as BS, Body Temperature as BodyTemp, HeartRate and RiskLevel. All these are the responsible and significant risk factors for       
  maternal mortality, that is one of the main concerns of SDG of UN.
